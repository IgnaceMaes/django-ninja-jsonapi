# Limitations & Roadmap

## Current limitations

- Some advanced JSON:API edge cases (deep relationship workflows and full atomic semantics) need broader integration coverage.
- The current test suite has broad unit coverage but still needs deeper end-to-end API integration coverage.

## Roadmap ideas

- Expand integration tests for full CRUD payload validation through Ninja test client.
- Expand relationship + include + atomic integration scenarios.
- Raise coverage threshold gradually as integration tests are added.
